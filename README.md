RockPaperSci  
============

This was a fun challenge I did during week 7 of my course at Makers Academy.

It's an expansion of the classic selection method game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard and Spock: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock

The computer's decision is entirely randomized. The player chooses an option, then is told whether he won or lost via a flash message that slides down every time he picks another move. 

This task was my first time using JS. The full stack includes:
* Javascript, using jQuery
* Ruby
* HTML & CSS
* Git 
* Test-driven-development with RSpec & Jasmine
